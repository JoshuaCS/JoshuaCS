### Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh, and I work with companies to deliver world-class software. I'm currently Head of Engineering @ LeapForward.

I specialise in building teams who ship on-time, reliable and secure code. Industry doesn't matter to me, it's a great chance to learn about type of business. Here's some of the companies I've worked with recently:

- Re-built platform from ground up for scale and security
- Hired out engineering, design and product teams to create an efficient and effective software machine
